## Road to Data Science 2019
Testing Ground for Data python exercises and Case Studies
I began by taking course on DataCamp and wanted to continue learning on DataQuest. I wanted to start tracking the courses and exercises in order to keep me accountable
This project will contain all my completed projects through DataQuest as a guide to help me work through the learning process.
